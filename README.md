# Truffle üçÑ

> The first open-source framework for AI-powered web automation that builds on Playwright and learns globally.

Truffle extends Playwright with AI capabilities for web automation and data extraction, while introducing revolutionary global caching of AI interactions that the entire community can benefit from.

```python
from truffle import wrap
async def extract_products():
    page = await wrap(browser)  # Wraps any Playwright browser
    await page.goto("https://example.com/products")
    # AI-powered automation with community-shared intelligence
    products = await page.get_main_list()
    # Use familiar Playwright syntax with AI assistance when needed
    for product in products:
        title = await product.get_text("h2")
        price = await product.get_text("[data-price]")
```
